### Project list
1.	Child care cost analysis
Data visualization and presentation: 
•	Exploratory analysis of the data from national database of childcare price, choose an audience group and use 3 mediums of choice to deliver the information/conclusion, then drive a call of action. 

2.	Kia Theft data analysis
Data analysis and visualization: 
•	Based on kia car theft data from usafact.org, use power BI, R and Excel to analysis the data, build a story of car theft theory and drive a call of action.

3.	Income level prediction
Predictive Analytics: 
•	Through predictive analytics on correlated data from 1994 Census Bureau database, build machine learning models which can predict individual’s income level; evaluate and compare the model performances, select the best model for the application.

4.	Predictive modeling 
Predictive Analytics: 
•	Through predictive analytics, use correlated data from 1994 Census Bureau database to build machine learning models which can predict individual’s income level; evaluate and compare the model performances, select the best model for the application.
5.	Modeling skills
Model optimization: 
•	Exercise different model optimization methods, like dimensionality reduction and feature selection, Hyperparameter tuning like min-max scaler, KNN. Evaluate the performance and find the best hyperparameters.

6.	Classification models and clustering
Logistics regression: 
•	Use stemmed data, exercise logistics regression techniques like SVM, tf-idf vectorization, also perform model evaluation

7.	Neural networks
Image classification: 
•	Using mnist dataset, build a convolution neural network to classify hand written digits.

8.	Regression model
Linear and Polynomial models: 
•	Practice multiple regression models, visualize the correlation, develop 3 regression models, like linear, random forest and polynomial, then evaluate the performance.

9.	SQL database development 
Data analysis and SQL database development: 
•	Getting data through API call, web scrapping and python data frame manipulation, build/reveal relationships between data and create a flight information database. 

10.	Data exploration and analysis
EDA and Regression model: 
•	Using Python EDA and statistical package, profile and explore used car sales data. Describe and visualize the statistical characters of the data and provide summary and suggestions.
